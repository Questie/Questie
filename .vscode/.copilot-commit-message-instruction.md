Generate a commit message for the staged changes.
The commit message should be structured with one change per line if multiple distinct logical changes are present.

For EACH distinct logical change identified in the staged files, create a new line in the commit message.
Each line MUST follow this format: `[category_tag] PastTenseVerb Concise description of that specific change.`

Available category tags and their purpose:
*   `[feature]` - New user-facing features or significant enhancements.
*   `[fix]` - General user-facing bug fixes not specific to other categories.
*   `[quest]` - Quest additions, fixes, objective updates, pre-req changes.
*   `[db]` - Database changes (items, NPCs, spawns, map data, game objects).
*   `[locale]` - Localization or translation updates.
*   `[perf]` - Changes improving performance, speed, or resource usage.
*   `[ui]` - Changes to user interface elements or user experience.
*   `[refactor]` - Internal code restructuring or improvements without changing external user-facing behavior.
*   `[tooling]` - Additions or Updates to developer tools, scripts, or internal utilities.
*   `[maint]` - Routine maintenance, code cleanup, comment updates, typo fixes in code/comments, or other small internal improvements.
*   `[toc]` - Updates to the toc file, for example addition, removal of files or creation/rename/delete of .toc file


The description for each line MUST start with a verb in PAST TENSE (e.g., Added, Fixed, Updated, Improved, Removed, Changed, Marked, Implemented, Corrected, Optimized, Refactored, Enhanced, Cleaned, Clarified).
Be specific for each line. If it's a quest, mention the quest name. If it's an item/NPC, mention it.

Example of a multi-line commit message (each line is part of the same commit):
[quest] Fixed pre-quests for Golden Lotus quests in VoEB
[db] Greatly improved friendlyToFaction for MoP NPCs
[refactor] Simplified NPC data retrieval logic
[tooling] Added _dotenv.lua for environment variable management

Another example:
[feature] Implemented the new "Pet Journal" search functionality
[ui] Adjusted padding on the Pet Journal entries for better readability
[maint] Removed unused import from PetJournal.lua
[toc] Updated .toc files to load _dotenv.lua for environment settings

If there's only one logical change, provide a single-line commit message as before (e.g., `[fix] Corrected a minor display issue`).

Focus on WHAT was changed for each line, ensuring the description starts with a past tense verb.
