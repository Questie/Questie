# Licensing

## Note to contributors

If you are considering contributing to Questie please be aware that submitting pull requests after <cutoff date/version, to be determined> will be counted as consent for licensing your contribution under the GPL v3 license.

If you are a former contributor please consider adding your name to the GPL v3 list below, or giving us consent to do so for you through an issue or a Discord message.

If you are a former contributor and feel any of the things discussed here are infringing on your copyrights please contact us through the aformentioned means.

## Third party software licensing

The libraries in the `Libs` directory are third-party-software and their individual licenses apply.

## Other licensing

If any subdirectory contains a `LICENSE.md` file it takes priority for the licensing of files in that directory.

## Questie's licensing

### All rights reserved disclaimer

Because Questie historically never had a license the situation is inconsistent and it is unlikely we will be able to gather consent from all the, at the time of writing, 91 historic contributors for a specific license, so when in doubt consider Questie as "all rights reserved".

That being said, the Questie team considers historic contributions made in the spirit of open source development, although of course we cannot make that statement on behalf of all individual former contributors.

### GPL v3

In an effort to clear the licensing situation up we will try to gain enough consent for GPL v3 license coverage so that we can consider the remaining unlicensed contributions as being public domain. For a copy of the GPL v3 license see `Licenses/gpl-3.0.txt`.

The following contributors have agreed to put their individual contributions under this license:

* Muehe
