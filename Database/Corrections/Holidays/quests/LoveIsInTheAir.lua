-- These "Crushing the Crown" quests are dailies, handed out based on the player's current level.
-- The Durotar + Elwynn quests are available at level 5, with each successive quest being available
-- at 14, 23, 32, 41, 51, 61, and 71, respectively. They are exclusive to each other; once you hit 14,
-- you can no longer pick up the level 5 quest. However, since we have no way of filtering quests based
-- on a "maximum" level, we simply hide all of the higher level ones, which will be picked up automatically
-- instead of the level 5 one. Users can only tell the difference if they're watching quest IDs.
-- TODO: If we implement maxLevel, these hacky workarounds should be implemented properly.
