Hello, thanks for taking the time to contact us!

Before you proceed, please verify that you're running the latest version of Questie. The easiest way to do this is via the Curseforge client, but you can also download the latest version here: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie

Questie is one of the most popular Classic WoW addons, with over 30M downloads. However, like almost all WoW addons, it's built and maintained by a team of volunteers.
